                    This website was created entirely for my own learning.
                    There is nothing else to see here except pictures of dogs
                    everywhere. Hope you like it!

                    This is a samoyed! They're my favorite dog breed in terms
                    of appearance, because they look so fluffy and white :3

                    This is my second favorite dog breed: a husky! I like the grey
                    and white fur and their long nose hehe.

                    My parents found a dog outside and adopted it for a few days.
                    It was a pomeranian! They're quite small and very cute, but
                    our dog was very disobedient.

                    This is another very popular dog breed: the shiba inu! It's
                    a very iconic dog in the meme world and is known as Doge. Very
                    cute and my girlfriend likes this dog breed the most!
